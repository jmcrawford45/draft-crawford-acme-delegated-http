             Delegated HTTP-01 Validation in ACME Protocol
               draft-crawford-acme-delegated-http-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes an extension to the ACME protocol to enhance
   the HTTP-01 challenge type by allowing for delegation, enabling
   validation requests to be directed to a designated server.  This
   approach mirrors the functionality currently possible with DNS-01
   challenges via DNS CNAME records, aiming to improve the flexibility
   and scalability of the HTTP-01 validation method.

1.  Introduction

   The Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol
   provides mechanisms for validating domain control using several
   challenge types, including HTTP-01 and DNS-01.  While DNS-01
   challenges allow for delegation using DNS CNAME records, HTTP-01
   challenges currently require direct hosting of challenge responses on
   the domain being validated.  This document introduces a mechanism to
   delegate HTTP-01 validation requests to a designated server.  By
   leveraging DNS records to redirect HTTP validation, this proposal
   enables centralized management of validation requests while
   addressing challenges associated with validating domains hosted on
   corporate networks or behind firewalls.  Delegated HTTP validation
   combines the following benefits from the existing DNS-01 and HTTP-01
   validation methods.

   *  *Centralized Management*: Enables centralized management of
      challenge responses, reducing the complexity of managing multiple
      domains.

   *  *Reduced Exposure*: Eliminates the need for direct access to the
      primary web server for validation.

   *  *Performance*: Reduces latency compared to DNS-01 challenges by
      allowing synchronous validation.

   *  *Security*: Avoids risks associated with exposing DNS API
      credentials.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Delegated HTTP Validation

   This proposal extends the HTTP-01 challenge type to support
   delegation using a DNS record, similar to the approach used for
   DNS-01 challenges.  The process is as follows: 1. *DNS
   Configuration*: The domain owner creates a DNS record for _acme-
   challenge.<YOUR_DOMAIN> pointing to a server capable of serving HTTP
   requests.  For example: _acme-challenge.example.com CNAME validation-
   server.example.net 2. *Challenge File Provisioning*: The designated
   server hosts the challenge file at the path /.well-known/acme-
   challenge/<TOKEN>, containing the domain authorization string. 3.
   *Validation Request*: The ACME server performs the following steps: -
   Attempts validation using the standard HTTP-01 method. - If the
   HTTP-01 method fails or if delegation is detected, constructs a URL
   using _acme-challenge.<YOUR_DOMAIN> and sends an HTTP GET request to
   the designated server. 4. *Validation Response*: The designated
   server responds with the authorization string, which the ACME server
   verifies against the expected value. 5. *Challenge Completion*: If
   the validation succeeds, the challenge status is updated to “valid.”
   If it fails, the status is updated to “invalid,” with diagnostic
   information provided.

4.  Security Considerations

   *  Relies on the security of both DNS and the delegated server.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
