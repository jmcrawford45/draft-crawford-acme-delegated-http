             Delegated http-01 Validation in ACME Protocol
               draft-crawford-acme-delegated-http-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes an extension to the Automated Certificate
   Management Environment (ACME) !RFC8555 protocol to enhance the
   http-01 challenge type (see Section 8.3 of [RFC8555]) by allowing for
   delegation, enabling validation requests to be directed to a
   designated server.  This approach mirrors the functionality available
   with dns-01 (see Section 8.4 of [RFC8555]) challenges via DNS CNAME
   records, aiming to improve the flexibility and scalability of the
   http-01 validation method.

1.  Introduction

   The ACME protocol provides mechanisms for validating domain control
   using several challenge types, including http-01 and dns-01.  While
   dns-01 challenges allow for delegation using DNS CNAME records,
   http-01 challenges require direct hosting of challenge responses on
   the domain being validated.  This document introduces a mechanism to
   delegate http-01 validation requests to a designated server.  By
   leveraging DNS records to redirect HTTP validation, this proposal
   enables http-01 validation while addressing challenges associated
   with validating domains hosted on corporate networks, on load
   balancers, or behind firewalls.  Delegated HTTP validation combines
   the following benefits from the existing dns-01 and http-01
   validation methods.

   *  *Centralized Management*: Enables centralized management of
      challenge responses, reducing the complexity of managing multiple
      domains.

   *  *Reduced Exposure*: Eliminates the need for direct access to the
      primary web server for validation.

   *  *Performance*: Reduces latency compared to dns-01 challenges by
      allowing synchronous validation.

   *  *Security*: Avoids risks associated with exposing DNS API
      credentials.

   *  *Scalability*: Enables parallelized validation of domains on
      distributed load balancers.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Delegated HTTP Validation

   This proposal extends the http-01 challenge type to support
   delegation using a DNS record, similar to the approach used for
   dns-01 challenges.  The process for validating example.com is as
   follows:

   1.  *DNS Configuration*: The domain owner creates a DNS record for
       _acme-challenge.example.com pointing to a server capable of
       serving HTTP validation requests.  For example:

       _acme-challenge.example.com.  CNAME validation-server-
       example.net.

   2.  *Challenge File Provisioning*: The designated server hosts the
       challenge file at the path /.well-known/acme-challenge/{token},
       containing the domain authorization string.

   3.  *Validation Request*: The ACME server attempts validation in the
       following order:

       *  http://_acme-challenge.example.com/.well-known/acme-
          challenge/{token}

       *  http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/{token}

       An ACME server MUST try the undelegated URL if the delegated URL
       fails.

   4.  *Validation Response*: The designated server responds with the
       authorization string, which the ACME server verifies against the
       expected value.

   5.  *Challenge Completion*: If the validation succeeds, the challenge
       status is updated to “valid.” If it fails, the status is updated
       to “invalid,” with diagnostic information provided.

4.  Security Considerations

   *  Relies on the security of both DNS and the delegated server.

5.  IANA Considerations
